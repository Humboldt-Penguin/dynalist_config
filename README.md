I use a website/app called Dynalist (very similar to Workflowy) to manage my life. Here is how I describe it in a reddit comment:

> I tried literally (literally) everything in this thread for about a year and settled on Dynalist (pretty much the same as Workflowy) for about three years now.
> 
> I'm mainly a student + research assistant, and I use Dynalist to organize pretty much everything in my life from to do lists, projects, literature notes, personal improvement, class notes, etc. In total I have about 80,000 bullet points.

> In my opinion, having a bunch of pretty widgets/features/whatnot is fun at first, but eventually makes things unnecessarily complicated and slows down large documents. After a year of pretty and convoluted Notion setups, most people I know just go minimalist/barebones anyways. Dynalist/Workflowy restrict you to collapsible bullets which keep things very fast and minimal, and I found out that's all you really need. It improves the way you structure/access information to be more efficient and I can't really imagine anything better.

In the pro version (or 14 day free trial which I keep making new accounts for), you can go to `Menu > Settings > Dynalist Pro > Custom CSS` to customize the way your Dynalist looks. This repository contains that styling file, just copy paste it in. Feel free to remove sections, change color/opacity values, and play around in other ways. Here are some helpful resources to make it your own:

* [Dynalist Custom CSS for Dummies](https://talk.dynalist.io/t/dynalist-custom-css-for-dummies/7603)
* [Post your current Custom CSS (with comments)!](https://talk.dynalist.io/t/post-your-current-custom-css-with-comments/3126)
* [Dynalist Themes & Skins](https://userstyles.org/styles/browse/dynalist)

Conveniently, you can paste the CSS into a document in dynalist so if you don't want to use a certain feature (e.g. `/* highlight */`), simply collapse that bullet point, select all by pressing ctrl+A a few times, and then paste it into the custom CSS menu again. That way you've made the change without deleting any information.
